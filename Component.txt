Component 👍
              1>- A piece of code that can reuse 
              2>- such as function
              3>- Most powerful then simple function 
              4>- header and footer is best example

              
 Two type of Component 🎈   
                           1>- functional Component
                           2>- Class Component  
                           3>- App.js file itself a Component   
                           4>- you can make component in same file such as file name "app.js" 
                           5>- you can make a component in different file 'file name your choice' 🎈

😀 yon can used one component into another component but you cannot  access it outside of component 😀
