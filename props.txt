1>what is props ?
                💖 we pass props in component such as we pass a parameter in function
                 called props
                💖 props full meaning is "properties"
                💖 "properties" help make component more dynamic
1>Use of props ?
                💖props are passed to component in  the way  similar to that of "html tag attribute"
                💖props in a component are read only and cannot be changed


3>💖  Are props mutable? Can a component modify its own props?
Ans:🤎
     props are immutable mean ==> "props in a component are read only and cannot be changed or modify"

4>💖 What is the purpose of using defaultProps in a React component?
   Ans:🤎
            
 React mein, default props ka istemal kiye jate hain taki component ke liye agar koi
  specific prop provide nahi hoti to default value istemal ho. Yeh teen important points hain:

Default Props:🤎
               Default props React mein component ke liye default values provide karte hain.

Tayyari:🤎
         Default props ko tayyar karte waqt, aap apne component class or function component mein defaultProps object bana sakte hain, jisme har prop ke liye default value specify ki jati hai.

Istemal:🤎
         Agar kisi prop ko parent component se provide nahi kiya jata to React defaultProps se default value istemal karta hai.
