total life cycle divided into three part
           1> mounting
           2> updating
           3> removing


1>ðŸ’– Mounting
             work such as a uploading and four predefine component are used in mounting
             which component are used for execute to manipulate
 1> Constructor()
 2> Static
 3> Render()
 4> ComponentDidMount()


  1> Constructor
                  are used in Class Component 
                  and its execute first when class component call 
                  and supper() method are used into Constructor 
  supper()
            is used to call parent Constructor

 3> Render()
             render method are only used in Class Component
             render method are used anythings for execute to represented
             my all html code into render method
             when we any change into "state or props" then render() method itself re-rendering
             we cannot update render() method "react.js" automatically update

 4> ComponentDidMount()
                        We using ComponentDidMount for calling API
                        first of all Constructor method call and then Render() method call and last call ComponentDidMount() method
                        when "html and dom" are ready or "upload" then ComponentDidMount() call
